# PingMe - Real-Time Chat Application


**PingMe** is a modern, real-time chat application built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and powered by **Socket.IO** for seamless, instant messaging. It offers a WhatsApp-like user experience with features like text, emoji, and image messaging, an interactive sidebar for online users, and customizable themes. User authentication is secured with **JWT** and **bcrypt**, while profile pictures are managed via **Cloudinary**. The frontend leverages **Redux Toolkit** and **Async Thunk** for efficient state management and API interactions.

- Optimized backend controllers with efficient queries, input validation, and Cloudinary integration.



- Advanced Redux Toolkit and Async Thunk usage for streamlined state management and enhanced sidebar with last message timestamps and online user filtering.



- Added emoji support (emoji-picker-react), image messaging, profile picture updates, and customizable themes.
- Chat interface ui enhanced.
